      <h3>Basic History</h3>
      <p>With the advent of wireless communications in the early 1900s, both civilians and militaries saw an increasing need to shield communications. In 1918, Arthur Scherbius, a German engineer, developed his version of the mechanical rotating substitution cipher system called the ‘Enigma.’ Starting in 1923 he sold the machine publicly in Berlin. The original product was designed to be sold to commercial entities such as banks looking to encrypt their confidential communications. Three years later, the German Navy manufactured their own version of Enigma. The army followed in 1928 and then the air force in 1933. The machine went through multiple models that grew both lighter and more secure with each iteration.</p>

          <p>The German Wehrmacht bought the Enigma D model and adapted it military purposes in 1932, renaming it the Enigma I. It had three rotors that could be adjusted manually. Each of the branches of the German military took their own approaches to developing the Enigma Machine for their uses. Each varied in the number of rotors that they had and some had extra features. From 1935 onward each of the branches incorporated the plugboard for extra security. During the war there were extra reflector plates to be swapped in an out when needed. In 1942, the Kriegsmarine (German Navy) implemented their famous four rotor system M4 model, which made the cipher significantly more difficult to crack. </p>

      <p>With the addition of the plugboard to the Wehrmacht version of Enigma, the cipher became virtually unbreakable because of the massive number of possibilities it added. No one bothered to attempt at cracking it. It wasn’t until 1932 that the Polish Cipher Bureau cracked the code. Marian Rejewski, Henryk Zygalski and Jerzy Rozicki used mathematics to create an electro-mechanical machine called the Bombe to crack messages. They exploited the two faults in the code. Firstly, the Germans used a specific set of rotors and settings with these rotors and reflectors. Secondly, because of the reflector, an input could never be the same letter and the encrypted letter. This opened the door to code-breakers. The Bombe was flawed and slow, but worked for the Wehrmacht M3. All of the information gathered by analysis of German communications using the Bombe was given the codename “Ultra.”</p>
      <p>The Kriegsmarine model of the Enigma posed a new problem for codebreakers. It had a fourth rotor which made the Bombe ineffective. At the British codebreaking center located in Bletchley Park, Alan Turing and Gordon Welchman developed their own version of the Bombe in 1940. The Turing Bombe used an entirely different principle than the Bombe developed by the Polish. It was able to search for Enigma settings based on a small ‘crib.’ A crib could be any piece of standardized message, such as ‘heil Hitler’ in the code which would allow the machine to guess the rest of the code based on the crib guess. </p>
      <p>According to Winston Churchill, Alan Turing’s cracking of the German Enigma Cipher was the single largest contribution to the Allied war effort against Nazi Germany. It is estimated that cracking the Enigma Code ended the war two years quicker because the Allies were able to anticipate German attacks and intercept U-Boat communications. Turing is also known as the father of the field of Computer Science. </p>

      <p>The Engima Machine is based on a simple substitution cipher. This means that a given letter is translated into a another letter as part of a corresponding different alphabet order. What makes the Enigma substitution cipher so strong is that is the substitution changes with each press of the key. In the standard M3 model there are three rotors, a reflector plate and a plugboard. The user presses a button on the keyboard and an electrical current is carried through the plugboard. The plugboard is a simple, manually controlled, substitution. The user had a cord with a plug on each end and in order to substitution an A for a T, they plug the two ends into the corresponding locations. The current travels through the plugboard to the first rotor where the letter is shifted yet again based on the wiring in the rotor. This takes place for the next two rotors as well and then is sent to the reflector plate which shifts it once more before sending the current back through the rotors in reverse order. The effect of the reflector is to make it impossible for an input letter to be the same as the encoded letter and then to send it back through for more encryption. Once it has traveled back through the rotors, the current is sent to the lampboard which display what the final letter has been substituted to. Depending on the settings of the machine, there are up to 9 possible shifts for one letter. After a letter is encrypted, the first rotor shifts one positions. When that cycles once, the second rotor shifts one positions, and so on with the third and fourth rotors. </p>
      <p>There are customization options for the Enigma Machine in order to communicate messages between two machines. The user can set the starting positions of each of the rotors and set up to ten pairs of shifts on the plugboard. It is also possible to switch out the rotors for different options and to also order them in different ways. The rotors themselves can also be altered by choosing a different starting position for the wiring inside each of them. There were also multiple different reflector plates that could be used. </p>
      <p>These settings changed on a daily basis to preserve encryption integrity. The settings were given out to the officers using the Enigma machines for only a month at a time. This meant that if one of these sheets was captured, the Allied powered could only have their communications for a very limited amount of time. </p>
